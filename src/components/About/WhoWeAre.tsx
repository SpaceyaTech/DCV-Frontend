            Founded in 1994, Diani Childrenâ€™s Village was established with a
            profound mission: to provide orphans, neglected, and abandoned
            children with a loving and nurturing environment. Over the years, we
            have grown into a registered charity supported primarily by
            dedicated staff who are committed to transforming the lives of these
            vulnerable children.{" "}

            At our home, we ensure that each child's basic needs, such as
            healthcare, education, and recreation, are met, giving them the hope
            and foundation they need for an independent life. Our goal is to
            support them until they are ready to embark on their own journeys,
            equipped with the skills and confidence to thrive.
