              A few years ago, we built a furniture-workshop. The main aim of
              this project is to teach the children some basic skills to improve
              their employment opportunities in the future.
              <br />
              <br />
              Several sponsors and well-wishers have helped to equip the
              workshop with all the necessary tools and materials.
              <br />
              <br />
              The workshop manager, Ishmael, has a lot of experience in woodwork
              and makes the most fantastic pieces. Hotels, schools and
              individuals are supporting this project by placing their orders
              for example beds, shelves, cupboards, chairs, tables etc.
